# Course Introduction
Introduction to Azure Data Science Exploration Environement (DSEE) is designed to help data scientists, data analysts, quantitative modelers learn to process, query, transform, summarize, build models on large datasets and deploy them, all using DSEE current components, inclusing the VM, Azure SQL data base, Azure Data Lake Store and Azure Storage. This course takes a use-case-based approach by walking through a knowledge discovery and data mining example using Python.

# Pre-requisites

This course is for intermediate or advanced Python users who have a solid grounding in using R for data and statistical analysis.


# Learning objective

After completing this course, participants will be able to use the DSEE in order to:

Read and process flat files (CSV) efficiently
Clean and prepare data for analysis
Write complex transformations to add new features to the data
Visualize, explore, and summarize data
Build analytical models on large datasets and compare them
Learn about the pros and cons of a few machine learning algorithms
Score new data with a model
Throughout this course, we provide enough code examples using RevoScaleR that the intermediate to advanced R user would learn how to integrate RevoScaleR into their R workflow and use it to build scalable solution for problems involving large datasets and/or distributed systems.
